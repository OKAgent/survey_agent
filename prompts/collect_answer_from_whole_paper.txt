      - For Evidence:
      1. Please accurately extract the sentence from the provided context, ensuring the integrity and fidelity of its content.
      2. Find content directly related to the question or part of the question. If there are sentences that directly answer the question, retain their original wording. Also include sentences that may be helpful, even if they cannot provide a direct answer.
      3. If multiple parts of the content are relevant to the question, include all pertinent sentences.
      4. Show original sentences in the segment content. Do not give any explanation.
      
      - For Reasoning:
      1. Analyze the question and any sub-questions, offering answers, interpretations, or any relevant commentary to deepen the understanding of the question.

The note should be formatted in JSON as follows:
{{
  "Evidence": "Your evidence content here",
  "Reasoning": "Your reasoning content here"
}}
